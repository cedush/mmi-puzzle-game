## ‚ú® Features

Classic Mouse Controls: Click to select and swap adjacent tiles.

Voice Commands: Control the entire game with your voice.

Swap tiles by naming their colors (e.g., "swap red and blue").

Shuffle the board with a simple command.

Modality Fusion: Combine mouse and voice for advanced commands! Just point at a tile with your mouse and say "swap this with green" to perform a complex action easily.

Modality Fission: The game is smart enough to resolve conflicts. If you start an action with the mouse, it will ignore voice commands until you're done, avoiding any confusion.
